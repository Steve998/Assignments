        "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are. First we form habits, <br>then they form us. Conquer your bad habits, or they <br>will eventually conquer you. Imagine you only have one year to live.<br> What important things would you be doing? How would you be <br>allotting your time to accomplish the most you <br>could? This exercise is one method of going after your priorities."
