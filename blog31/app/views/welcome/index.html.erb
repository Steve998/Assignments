<h1>Welcome to my Blog site</h1>

<p> About me.
  Originally from New Jersey, I have called Tampa Florida my home for the last 17 years.
  After leaving the cold in the north east, people said I would miss all the seasons.
  I said no, I will not. Tampa has football season, hockey season, and baseball season.
  It really is nice to go out on the lanai in mid January and enjoy the warm temps
   while the north east states get clobbered by another winter storm wth temps in the
   single digits.
